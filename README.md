#Cheapest Flight Ticket Generation and Booking Via CLI-BOT
#Overview
A Command Line Interface (CLI) bot designed to streamline the process of finding and booking the cheapest flight tickets for users. This bot integrates the latest langchain Model to gather user preferences and employs Playwright to automate interactions with Yatra.com. The langchain model analyzes scraped JSON data, presenting the top 5 cheapest flights. The bot guides the user through selecting a preferred ticket and utilizes Playwright for the final booking process. The entire end-to-end ticket booking process is automated, with user confirmation needed only for payment via phone notification.
